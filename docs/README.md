## Project Documentation

To generate the documentation, run the `make docs` command in the root directory of the project.
Then open the `docs/html/index.html` file in a web browser to view the documentation.

The documentation is generated from the [index.scrbl](index.scrbl) file using Scribble, Racket's documentation tool.
